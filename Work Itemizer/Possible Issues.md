# Names
- The chatbot is provided with names from the first 200 work items (Single Request Limit)
- if the name required in a WIQL is not present within them the user must enter the full name exactly.
## How to avoid?
- Request multiple times in batches to get all work items 
## Issue
- Big overhead maybe?
