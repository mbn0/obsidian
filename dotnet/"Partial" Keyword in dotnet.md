The partial keyword allows the definition of a class to be split across multiple files. This is useful for several reasons:

Separation of Concerns: You can organize your code better by keeping different aspects of a class in separate files. For example, if you have additional configurations or methods that you want to add later, you can do so without modifying the auto-generated file.

Maintainability: When working with auto-generated code, like that produced by scaffolding, it can help keep your custom code separate from the generated code, making it easier to maintain and update.
